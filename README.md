# BioScript
A project to organize scripts used in bioinformatics analysis.

## Introduction
This project provides a way to organize various scripts used in bioinformatics analysis, based on different types of data or tasks. By classifying and organizing these scripts into a well-structured file directory, users can easily access and reuse the scripts that they need. 

## Directory Structure
The directory structure is designed according to different types of data or tasks.
In this structure, each task has its own folder containing scripts and results related to that task. In the 'Scripts' folder, you can store various processing scripts for each step, and further subdivide and organize them by adding subfolders as needed. In the 'Results' folder, you can store logs and output files from each step. 

##  Usage
To use this project, simply download or clone this repository, and then modify or add your processing scripts and result files in accordance with the above directory structure. You can choose your preferred programming language (Python, R, etc.) to write the processing scripts.
